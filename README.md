# 02-Guess-the-number

The purpose of this assignment was to create a game in which the user is given a number of chances to guess a number randomly chosen.

I accomplished this by using loops where everytime the user guessed wrong and it went back to the start, a variable, named guesses would increase by 1. If guesses reached 10, the program would inform the user that they failed before ending. However, users were given various hints as they guessed in order to help them reach the number they were looking for. This was achieved by using operators to compare the guess with the answer.
